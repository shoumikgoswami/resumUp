# ResumUp A self service resume booster suite for Job seekers

A resume enhancing/boosting suite offered to Job seekers to help them build the right resume with keywords for their dream job. Idea behind this is usually when job seekers are looking out for their jobs, they either create their resume themselves or by a resume creating service. 
In the first case, the job seeker does not have much to work with and ends up creating a generic resume. They are usually not ATS friendly which means they lack the keywords for a particular job and hence, they do not get picked up by the company’s ATS systems. ResumUp will be a self-service suite which a job seeker can use to 
### Look up sample resumes –
-	The idea behind this module is to offer sample resumes to the user so that he can refer to the resumes and create his own. 
-	The module will take Job Profile (e.g. Data Scientist) as input and will output 5-10 (start with 5 initially) resumes which he can download in PDF.
-	This will be a premium functionality.
###	Rate their resume based on the keywords and content -
-	The idea behind this module is to allow a user to rate his resume based on several parameters. The scoring algorithm is currently based on keywords but it will evolve with time and more parameters like length of the resume, availability of certain sections etc. will be added.
-	The module will take a PDF file upload as an input and will output different scores and their respective scores. Currently, it will output 1 score and label.
-	This will be a free service.
###	Compare how good fit the resume is against the job description 
-	The idea behind this module is to allow a user to check how well his resume fits the job description.
-	The module will take a resume PDF upload and job description as input. The user will copy the job description from the job post and paste it in a section inside this module. The output will be a similarity score.
-	This will be a free service.
###	Generate a PDF/HTML resume on the fly using a generator
-	The idea behind this module is to allow a user to build a PDF/HTML resume with formatting.
-	The user will be provided a form on which he will enter all the details. 
Once the user fills the form and posts it, the module will generate a downloadable PDF/HTML file. 
-	This can be a free service but the PDF will have ResumUp watermark on it, the paid module will remove this feature.
###	Optimize the resume 
-	The idea behind this module is to suggest optimal keywords to the user based on the resume and job description so that more common keywords are used in the resume.
-	The module will take the resume PDF upload and Job description as input and will output a table with recommendations.
-	This will be a premium service.
