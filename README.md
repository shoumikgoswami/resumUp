# ResumUp 
# A self service resume booster suite for Job seekers

A resume enhancing/boosting suite offered to Job seekers to help them build the right resume with keywords for their dream job. Idea behind this is usually when job seekers are looking out for their jobs, they either create their resume themselves or by a resume creating service. <br>
In the first case, the job seeker does not have much to work with and ends up creating a generic resume. They are usually not ATS friendly which means they lack the keywords for a particular job and hence, they do not get picked up by the companyâ€™s ATS systems. ResumUp will be a self-service suite which a job seeker can use to
